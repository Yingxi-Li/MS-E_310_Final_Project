 The simple and fast SGD-based learning algorithm with SGD approximation of dual price 
 achieves 83.93% of the offline revenue

 Convergence of the dual price vector to the true dual price vector see fugures.

 Note that this algorithm, despite achieving lower profit, doesn't require the solving of
 LPs. Thus, its runtime does not explode as the dimension of the LP increase.

 The approximated dual price vector converges to the true price to some degree 
 but not as well as when we use constant step size for update. The weighted updating step-size
 seems get more aggressive towards the end and causes the dual price to oscillate more.
