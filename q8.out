 Convergence of the dual price vector to the true dual price vector see fugures.

 Note that this algorithm, despite achieving lower profit, doesn't require the solving of
 LPs. Thus, its runtime does not explode as the dimension of the LP increase. Observing the profit 
 convergence, we see that this algorithm tends to drain the resources faster towards the beginning,  
 causing the peak and the subsequent drop in the profit.

 The approximated dual price vector exhibites desirable convergence to the true price. The  
 more aggressive weighted updating step-size causes the dual price to oscillate more  
 as the number of iteration increases.
